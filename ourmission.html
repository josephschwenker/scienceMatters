					<h3>Science Matters</h3>
					<p>It's hard to imagine a world without science: every area of our lives has been affected by it in some way. Here at Science Matters, we believe the effects have been for the better.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, not everyone agrees. Despite a strong scientific enterprise being paramount to a fruitful economy, education (including science education) is often first on politicians' list of programs to cut.</p>
					<p>But that's not all. Many politicians have denied evolution and climate change, while advocating for the teaching of creationism in public schools. Even the public has been swayed: 40% of Americans deny evolution.</p>

					<h3>Combating ignorance</h3>
					<p>We need to stop this anti-science movement. The future of our nation may depend on it. But making such a drastic cultural change is no easy task. And that's where we need your help.</p>
					<p>Science Matters is a non-profit organization dedicated to science advocacy. We believe that forging alliances with corporations is a threat to our neutrality, and so we rely on the contributions of our members. Our volunteers have spent over 10,000 hours educating, advocating, and protesting for science and science education.</p>

					<h3>Creating a sustainable culture</h3>
					<p>Intervention is expensive, and our ultimate goal is to make science a core value of this country. Science shouldn't need an organization to defend it; something that important needs to be a part of our culture.</p>
					<p>To that end, we go further than standard science education. Understanding evolution is one thing, but thinking like a scientist is quite another. As you read our articles, we hope that you'll come to understand why scientific thinking has so much to contribute to our culture.</p>
